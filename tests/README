This directory contains the outputs of various runs of the nulike_test_wimp
program, run with different speed settings.  The diffme file and fig7 results
from the nulike paper (arxiv:1601.00653) are for speed=0, i.e. the slow,
accurate mode.  The plot shows how the IC79 tautau limit changes as a
function of the speed setting.

Which speed setting you should use really depends on your application.
All results presented in arxiv:1601.00653 were done with speed = 0.
For most situations though, speed = 1 or speed = 2 is probably good enough.
