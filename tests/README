This directory contains the outputs of various runs of the nulike_test_wimp
program, run with different speed settings.  The diffme file is for speed=0,
i.e. the slow, accurate mode.  The plot shows how the IC79 tautau limit
changes as a function of the speed setting.

Which speed setting you should use really depends on your application.
The results presented in the nulike paper (arxiv:1601.00653) were all done
with speed = 0.  For most situations though, speed = 1 or speed = 2 is
probably good enough.
