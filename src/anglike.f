*** nulike_anglike returns the contribution of a single event to the 
*** unbinned likelihood, based on the reconstructed angle between
*** its arrival direction in the detector and the direction of the Sun.
*** This routine is used only with the 2012 likelihood.
***
*** input:  cosphi     cos(reconstructed angle from solar position)
***         parabsigma paraboloid (or other) sigma corresponding to 
***                    1 sigma angular error when considering a single
***                    dimension of a 2D Gaussian PDF (i.e. 39,3% C.L.,
***                    not 68%). (degrees)
***         f_S        signal fraction; percentage of predicted counts
***                    within analysis cut cone and energy range.
***                    expected to be due to signal rather than back-
***                    ground.
*** output:            ln(Likelihood / degrees^-1)
