HISTORY for nulike
---------------- v1.0.9: Apr 7, 2020
* Fixed bug appearing for very small thetas in lnpiln.
* Fixed warnings triggered with gcc 9.2

---------------- v1.0.8: Dec 5, 2019
* Fixed incompatibility with Release mode in recent cmake versions.

---------------- v1.0.7: Jan 3, 2018
* Fixed incompatibility with gfortran8.

---------------- v1.0.6: Oct 27, 2017
* Patched TSPACK to fix numerical instabilities causing nulike to hang with fast=3
  on Intel Knight's Landing (Xeon Phi x200) processors.

---------------- v1.0.5: June 9, 2017
* Updated build system to allow building in parallel with make -jN.

---------------- v1.0.4: May 4, 2017
* Fixed incompatibility with 2017 intel compilers.
* Updated build system slightly.

---------------- v1.0.3: May 25, 2016
* Added data files corresponding to curves shown in Fig 7 of arXiv:1601.00653.
* Updated JCAP journal reference for arXiv:1601.00653.

---------------- v1.0.2: Feb 13, 2016
* Fixed link order problem with examples, which caused DarkSUSY's version of
  TSPACK to override nulike's when linking to the (unofficial) shared version of
  DarkSUSY, and cause crashes due to DarkSUSY's version not being threadsafe.
* Made some other minor threadsafety fixes in TSPACK

---------------- v1.0.1: Jan 6, 2016
* Fixed TSPACK interpolation routines to provide proper thread safety when
  using the shared library version of the code
* Added additional speed settings; features a factor of 4-10 speedup in full
  likelihood calculations for e.g. tautau root-finding example. Models with
  minimal signal content are now much faster to compute.

---------------- v1.0.0: Dec 21, 2015
First tagged release.  Features much awesomeness.
