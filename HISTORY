HISTORY for nulike

---------------- v1.0.1: Jan 6, 2016
* Fixed TSPACK interpolation routines to provide proper thread safety when
  using the shared library version of the code
* Added additional speed settings; features a factor of 4-10 speedup in full
  likelihood calculations for e.g. tautau root-finding example. Models with
  minimal signal content are now much faster to compute.

---------------- v1.0.0: Dec 21, 2015
