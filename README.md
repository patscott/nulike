Nulike is software for including full event-level information in
likelihood calculations for neutrino telescope searches for dark matter
annihilation.

Full details can be found in the papers:
  1. Scott, Savage, Edsj√∂ & IceCube Collaboration 2012, JCAP 11:057, [arXiv:1207.0810](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0810)
  2. IceCube Collaboration 2016, JCAP 04:022, [arXiv:1601.00653](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00653)

If you use nulike for preparing a paper, please cite both of these.  If you use the 79-string IceCube likelihoods, don't forget to also cite the original IC79 WIMP paper:

Compilation
--

To compile nulike as a static library, edit [the makefile](makefile) and do
```
  make
```

To compile nulike as a shared library, instead do
```
  make libnulike.so
```

These libraries can then be linked against whatever driver program you
want to use to provide the neutrino flux at Earth from your favourite
dark matter model.  I recommend DarkSUSY 5.1.3 (www.darksusy.org) or
later, but in principle anything that computes a neutrino flux is OK
(just make sure it is threadsafe if you want to run nulike
multi-threaded).


Testing
--

To compile the nulike test programs, you must first install DarkSUSY and
enter the path to its library in [the makefile](makefile).  Then, depending on which
demo you want to run, you can do
```
  make nulike_test
  make nulike_test_wimp
  make nulike_test_mssm25
```
Please refer to the source code of these examples for descriptions of
options, etc.  If the output from nulike_test_wimp seems to match the
contents of [tests/nulike_test_wimp.diffme](tests/nulike_test_wimp.diffme), then things are working
properly.


Generating partial likelihoods
--

To (re-)compute partial likelihoods for later reuse in fast likelihood
calculations, you must first install nusigma (found from the WIMPSim
page at http://copsosx03.fysik.su.se/wimpsim/code.html) and enter the
path to its library in [the makefile](makefile).  Then,
```
  make nulike_prep
```
and
```
  ./nulike_prep
```
to get full usage instructions.
